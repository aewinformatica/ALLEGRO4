
AVFighters
==========

This is my entry for the SpeedHack 2003. It's a basic fighting 
game with player-vs-ai and player-vs-player modes, fractal-generated
atari-like music, fractal and 3D visual effects, and funny characters.

This entry satisfies the rules of this year competition:

1) Genre requirements:

- 3D Elements: When a fighter hits the other, a rotating 3D "star" 
  appears, stretches, shrinks and disappears.

2) Technical requirements

- Easter egg: When you hit the special-key-combo the fighters
  use their secret powers.
- Helping others: The taunts that fighters say when they're hit
  are written in the bottom of the screen. This feature can not
  be disabled because I can't put samples in the datafile, hence
  that is the only way for making 'sound effects'.

3) Artistic requirements
- Fractals: The music is generated by a fractal algorithm, and
  the special powers are fractal graphics.

The plot of this game is based on the characters and storylines
created by the Unicorn Studio (http://start.at/unicornio). The
graphics are also provided by them. Thank you guys!


Story
=====

It's 2075, computers and Internet have become the
supporting structure for the world society. But now
this structure is in danger: the computers have
evolved and got out of control. They have created the
worst menace for computer systems ever: Excesso, the
thinking virus.

No protection software has had a chance against Excesso,
not even the powerful Kitty Antivirus; and before it
destroys the whole network security systems, a group of
hackers and a group of researchers have created two
thinking antiviruses, two female-like AI's: Arina
Copperfield, developed by hackers, and Juliette Cheng,
created by scientists.

The two groups have to proof that their AI is better.
Arina and Juliette have to fight each other in a stage
made of bizarre computer graphics, in order to determine
who's the stronger fighter, and thus win the right to fight
and defeat Excesso.

Comments
========

I finally did it. The game has special powers, AI, cool graphics,
meets all the requirements and a good gameplay. It's not what 
I had planned, but it's just fine  anyway.

The size restriction on zip files was the main problem I had, since 
I couldn't put the frames for many actions in the datafile, and that
forced me to make the engine simpler.

Thanks to the guys from the Unicorn Studio I have some art expresso.
The graphics in the game look pixelized 'cause I had to shrink them
a lot to fit the size of the zip. The original drawings are just cool.

And thanks to Arron Shutt and all the people tha make this competitions
possible. It was fun!!
