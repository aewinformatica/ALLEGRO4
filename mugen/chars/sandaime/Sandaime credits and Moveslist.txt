--==MOVESLIST FOR TEDDY'S SANDAIME==--
--------------------------------------
a        =lightpunch
a,a      =lightpunch and stongpunch combo
D,F,b = Shiki Fuujin (Dead Demon Consuming Seal), ***, Only can do it if you have 100 HP or less
x        = Sandaime Dash Attack, *, Its pretty strong, more than 1/4 of the enemy's health if they have a regular defense stat.
D,D,y    = Enma Summon, ***, Powerful, but not a one hit KO
z        = Teleport, 1/10 *

--==HINTS==--
-------------
+If you do teleport repeatedly, you can do it infintely and can barely be hit(not a glitch)
+In case your wondering, Sandaime has a triple jump. I personally don't mind, but you can fix it if you like.

--==NOTES==--
-------------
+No AI, just beats the crap out of everything with anything he can do.
+He cannot be hit while doing: -Enma Summon
                               -Sandaime Dash
                               -Teleport
+The Only time Sandaime can be hit durin Shiki Fuujin is when the pole disappears.
