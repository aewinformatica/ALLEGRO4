Authors Comments:
Yeah, so this is the first beta version of my kakashi. 
If you got this with the Naruto Battle Arena download, check the site.
There will be a patch released that has the rest of his specials, his sound file,
and his polished-off, already existing specials. This version may not be the most
effective in combat, but keep in mind, this is the beta version and isn't quite
finished. His AI isnt programmed totally in this version either, so he may
be pretty cheap with the kawarimi, just bear with it.

NOTE: All other MUGEN saavy people out there

If any other mugen skilled person goes snooping around 
in my CNS file, i don't really care if you look at what i did and use it to better
learn how to do something for your character, just don't steal my codes. Also, if 
you find a code for a move that isnt in the cmd, there's a reason why I haven't 
implemented it yet, Even if the move technically works, it may look horrible or 
not work like i want it to. They will be included once i finish them and release 
the patch.

How to install the patch:

If the patch is available, to make him the full character, download it,
and open it using WinZip. Extract the files into kakashi's folder. If it
says something like "Do you wish to replace this file?" click "Yes to all"
Thats all.
