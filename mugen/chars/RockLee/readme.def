[Fighting System]
K, the way you fight with this character is like this (mugen controls):
a - light punch, b - medium punch, c - strong punch
x - light kick, y - medium kick, z - strong kick

The way you combo is you start with either a light punch or light kick. Then, you either press b or y to combo into either a medium punch or  medium kick.
You can then combo into a strong punch or strong kick with c or z. This will make it so your not just mashing one button the whole time. Kicks are stronger than 
punches but are slower and punches are weaker than kicks but are faster. Also, all the attacks have crouch and air moves.

[Special Moves]

Down, Foward, z - Omote Renge (requires 1000 power)
**Down, Back, z - Ura Renge (requires 3000 power)

* - It raises the speed of everything including attacks except Ura Renge cause it screws up the timing if it does. (Lasts the whole round unlike the old one)
** - Unblockable because you would be wasting 3000 power everytime if it wasn't.
