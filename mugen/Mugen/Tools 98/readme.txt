M.U.G.E.N Tools v0.98 beta
(c) 2000 Elecbyte
www.elecbyte.com

Included in this archive are AirEditor, sprmaker, sndmaker, and fntmaker.
The maker tools are needed to make .sff and .snd files used in M.U.G.E.N.
As you might have guessed, sprmaker works on graphics (.pcx files) and
sndmaker is for sound (.wav files).  See below (III) for an explanation
of fntmaker.

The documentation for AirEditor is in airedit.txt.


====================
I. Sprmaker
====================

Sprmaker essentially puts all your .pcx files into one .sff file.

What's New
----------

Elimatnate duplicate successive palettes (-p) now works!

Usage: sprmaker [-c] [-f] [-p] [-q]


Options: c - automatically crop images and adjust axes
         f - eliminate duplicate files
         p - eliminate duplicate successive palettes 
         s - summary mode (displays only summary and errors)

         q - quiet mode (except errors)


If you don't specify any options, then sprmaker will act exactly like the
previous versions.  


Usage
-----

Running sprmaker from the command line will show:

"Enter name of new or existing SFF file:  "

Once you enter a name, you'll be asked for the names of the
.pcx files.  Next, you'll be asked for group number, image number,
and the X and Y axis of the graphic.  For example, let's say you
are putting in a pcx file called test.pcx.  A sample output would
look like this:

Enter name of graphic file:  test.pcx
Group no:  1000 
Image no:  0
X axis:  45
Y axis:  35

The group number and image number entered here are used to access
test.pcx in the .air file.  The X and Y axis is used as a pivot point
for the graphic.  For example, if test.pcx was a 20x20 square and it's
axis was (10,10), then if it's drawn to the screen at location 
(100,100) the axis point will be drawn at (100,100) therefore the 
square will occupy a space on the screen from (90,90) to (110,110).

See air.txt and spr.txt in the mugx????.zip archive for more info
on what group numbers you should use.


You might be thinking:  I have 100 .pcx files.  I don't want to have
to type all that in everytime!  Well you don't.  Just make a plain
text file and put all the file names and data into that.  Here's part
of an example text file to get you started.  This way you just make
the text file once and then run sprmaker on it.

  ;Options
  #
  ;Palette 
  1
  ;Shared palette 
  2
  ;Filename:
  chars\test\test.sff
  work\test\mypic.pcx
  9000 
  0
  0
  0
  work\test\mypic2.pcx
  9000
  1
  0
  0


This is probably how you'd want to start your .txt file.  A semicolon
(;) is used for comments.  Comments can only be used at the beginning
of a line.  Pound sign (#) brings you to an options
menu.  There are 2 options "palette type" and "Override duplicate
file linking."  The two palette types you can choose are individual
and shared.  Individual means that this pcx will use it's own palette.
Shared means that the palette will share the same palette as the
other .pcx's also marked as shared.  You should use shared for all
your character sprites and you'd probably use individual for 
character portraits or projectiles since they may have many different
colors than the character sprites.  

Don't worry about "Override duplicate file linking."  It's a debugging
option when we were developing the .sff format.

Finally, you put the name of your .sff file and the names pcx files
and axes etc below...

You normally wouldn't use sprmaker on the command line directly.  The
easiest way is to redirect its input from a text file.  Assume the above
example was saved as mychar.txt then you would type this command at
the (DOS) command line:

sprmaker < mychar.txt
or if your text file is in the work directory then type
sprmaker < work\mychar.txt

If you don't get any errors, your .sff should be where you specified
in the text file.  In this example it would be in [current dir]\chars\test


====================
II. Sndmaker
====================

Sndmaker is essentially sprmaker except for sound.  Again, it's best
to redirect its input from a text file.

The format is the same as sprmaker minus the palette options and such.
Also, you don't need an X and Y axis.  

;Filename:
  chars/test/test.snd
  work/test/mysound.wav
  0 
  0
  work/test/mysound2.wav
  0
  1


If this file was saved as work/test/sound.txt, then you would type this
at the command line:

sndmaker < work\test\sound.txt


====================
III. Fntmaker
====================

The fonts generated by fntmaker work for 2000.06.27 and newer versions
of M.U.G.E.N.

pcx file - Supply a pcx file which contains all the characters in your font
           alphabet, arranged from left to right in a single row. The pcx
           file must be an 8-bit color sprite.
txt file - Copy a txt file from work/font in custom.zip, and edit it to fit
           your font's pcx file. The first part is are the font settings.
           It is followed by character and offset pairs. The character is a
           letter or symbol in your pcx file you wish to represent. The
           offset is the starting x location within the pcx file of the
           character. For example,
             B 55
           means that character 'B' begins at an offset of 55 pixels from the
           left. Semicolon is treated as a comment character. To put in
           entries for special characters such as a semi-colon, you need to
           use a hex sequence representing the ASCII number of the
           character. Hex sequences start with 0x. For example, a semicolon
           (ASCII value 5B) starting at pixel 100 would have an entry:
             0x5B 100

Fonts with more than one color use "color banks" in their palette to store
multiple color arrangements. Each color bank in the palette has a number of
palette entries equal to the value of the "Color" parameter in the font's
txt file. The first color bank starts at color 255, and its entries are
laid out in reverse palette order. The next color bank's first palette entry
starts immediately following the first, and so on. For example, a font with
16 colors has its first bank's entries from 255 to 240. The second bank has
entries 239 to 224 and so on. The number of banks you can have is limited by
the palette space.

Look at the files in custom.zip to see how fonts are composed in the .pcx
files. The concept of font banks will be clearer if you look at the
palette arrangement of some of the pcx files.
