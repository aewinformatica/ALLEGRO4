 SpeedHack Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-Evilness
 You control an evil grandmother who hates little girls and cats. 

-Radius of Influence
 In the first minigame (find da force) you can move objects with your 
 mind, but that power depends on the distance from that objects.

-Get a grip
 All the surfaces in the game have different friction values.

-Ratio, Respect!
 The game detects automatically the screen resolution and adjusts the 
 size of position of the elements in the game accordingly. In widescreen
 mode you get a larger view.

-Reverse Stereotypes
 The main character is an old grandma who has superpowers, drives a snow
 plough and hates little girls and cats. She is not the typical grand mother,
 is she?

-Dialogue
 In the third minigame (answer this!) a little girl asks you some questions
 that you have to answer to win. In addition, the have a conversation during
 the minigame.

REUSED PARTS OF THE SOURCE:

 I used a physics engine for allegro called Box 2D Lite. Classes Arbiter, 
 Body, Collide, Joint and World belong to that engine.
 Everything else was coded during the three days.

 About the Game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The game is composed by four different minigames that you have to complete
in 120 seconds or less.
I know that the game is quite hard, but I did it that way to do it
more challenging.
