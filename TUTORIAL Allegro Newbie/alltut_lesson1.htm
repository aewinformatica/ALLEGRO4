You must include the allegro header file or else nothing will work!<br>    <br>    <div class="codeBox">#include &lt;allegro.h&gt; // You must include the Allegro Header file</div>    <br>    Make sure your main always looks like the following. Don't worry if you aren't used to it, soon enough you will memorize this. <br>    <br>    <div class="codeBox">int main(int argc, char *argv[]) <br>{ </div>    <br>Next, we will <em>initialize</em> Allegro. This will set up all the components it needs in order to run. This function basically does all the hard stuff for you.    <br><br><div class="codeBox">allegro_init(); // Initialize Allegro</div><br>Now that Allegro is initialized we will want to set up an input device so the user will be able to control how the program will execute. For this program we want to include support only for  the keyboard. This function will set up all keyboard related functions and variables.<br><br><div class="codeBox">install_keyboard(); // Initialize keyboard routines</div><br>Ok. Almost everything is set up and ready to roll. There is one more part that needs to be done before we can process any kind of output to the user: setting up the screen. This next part can be a little tricky, and may take some time to get used to.<p><em>set_gfx_mode</em> will set the graphics mode that you will use in your program. Here is what each paramater is:<br>  <br>  set_gfx_mode(GRAPHICS MODE, Width, Height, Virtual Width, Virtual Height); </p><ul>  <li>Using GFX_AUTODETECT for a graphics mode will set everything for you, using the machine's preinstalled drivers.</li>  <li>The width and the height are simple that, the width and the height of the screen.</li>  <li>The V_Width and V_Height are the virtual (not visible) width and height of the screen. (We don't need to worry about these for the moment, so entering zeros will just create NO virtual screen.)</li></ul><div class="codeBox">set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT, 640,480,0,0); // Change our graphics mode to 640x480</div><p> This <em>almost</em> concludes Lesson 1. Now the screen will change to the desired resolution. In order to see the effect, we need to stall the program for a moment. This next function simply waits for any keypress from the keyboard. Once a key is presed it will then continue through the program.<br>  <br></p><div class="codeBox">readkey(); // Wait untill a key is pressed</div><p> After the key is pressed, we must tell the program that everything executed without error and then exit.<br>  <br></p><div class="codeBox">return 0; // Exit with no errors<br>}</div><p> We are not done yet, however. There is still <em>one</em> more thing that needs to be done. <strong>This part is very important</strong>. In every allegro program you write, you must include this function. The following function is Allegro specific - and your programs will not work unless it is found right after the closing bracket of your <em>main</em> function.<br>  <br></p><div class="codeBox">END_OF_MAIN() // This must be called right after the closing bracket of your MAIN function.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// It is Allegro specific.</div><p> This concludes Lesson 1. You now know how to set up an allegro environment and change the resolution of the screen. This is an important component in all allegro programs. You will use it in every program in the future.<br>  <br>  <a href="alltut_lesson2.htm">Continue to Lesson 2</a><br>  <a href="alltut_index.htm">Back to the main page</a><br>  <br>  </p></div></div></center></body></html>
