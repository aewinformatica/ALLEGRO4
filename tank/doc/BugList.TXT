Secret character unlock bug...   
If you shoot a sentry pod during the challenge against ShadowFang, 
The round ends in a tie. 



*****************************************
This is my listing of the current status for my copy of the source code. 
Will be released when site is ready. 

as of 21 Aug 2006 

Status Update as of 2006 08 20 
======== 
Colour bar on shot timer goes to top of screen in non-mulitplayer mode. 
Editor can show/hide HUD. 
Screenshot can be set to be bmp and /or jpeg (or nothing). 
Added video option to outline barrel. 
Modified AI to stop bots buying other bots specials. 
Modified artwork to stop tank slides and added water & lava where required. (Does not affect game play really!) 
Added a slot to the NIV screen so barrel can be seen. 

Update on Bug list 2006 07 16 
=============================

Console message that tank was killed by "a player off the server with a kick message" 

Liquid weapons still explode in mid air sometimes. Can any one find a repeatable method of causing this? 

Problems with the special levels not running to completion. 

Set random generator seed to help with dirt sync in multiplayer games. Other changes would require the network protocol to be changed and be non backward compatiable. 

Added tests to loading data files so now gives error message rather than crashing. 

In multiplayer, if client did not have same map as server, then it loaded a random one. Changed so it loads an internal one with error message. 

"Want list" C. Added menu item to editor to make water particles flow. 

Autodefense freeze in multiplayer. 
{fixed I think -- no comments yet} 

Modified code so it will compile correctly with Dev-C++ and CodeBlocks as well as MSC++ 6 & 7. 

Added jpeg as addition to screenshot. JPEG=90k BMP=1.4M. (Request by Picky33).

Current Bugs
============
    Liquid weapons sometimes explode in mid-air, rather than upon ground impact.
     {? -- }
    
    Fire Toad can do Friendly Fire even with friendly fire turned OFF.
    It seems to only happen after my bot friend has enabled a shield.
    It doesn't do friendly fire when they don't have a shield.
    After I took down his shield I was able to take him out next turn....
    Maybe you can only do damage to them after the shield is enabled but can continue to when it's gone? 
     {? -- }
    
    Sentries only work once in a level.
     {? -- }



Random Bugs (fixed  --  hopefully)
===========
    When you click end game on the esc menu it still sometimes just quits the program
     {fixed -- buttons offset so yes click is not transfered to quit button.}
    
    Button placement is a little bit off in the main menu.
     Like when you hover just barely above an option the option above it is highlighted.
     {fixed -- mouse cursor aligned to button text. Highlight added cause I like it.}
    
    The main menu music dosnt play after you've come back from a game.
     {fixed -- added music call where missing. Still to check multiplayer. }
    
    Music no longer cuts off when you go into editor mode.
     {No music in editor mode. Only plays when selected from menu. } 
    
    The "addbot" console command does not include the lobber or Gunner AI's. 
     {fixed -- not tested. }
    
    Reclassing an AI to a human player gives the human Mini-mirvs and other AI weapons. 
     {Reclassing is coded as a cheat. This is a method of getting upgraded weapons. Nothing done.}
     
    The heavy roller blows up as soon as it hits the wrap-around wall,
     rather than actually appearing on the other side of the screen.
     {roller & Fire Starter (crusers) are coded to explode at the wall regardless of type. }
    
    Esc key still kills the editor, taking the game to a non menu covered screen.
     {fixed -- reverts to main menu as per menu quit. }
    
    The interface won't allow you to save in certian folders (especially if it's outside the game folder) 
     {fixed -- extended to 256 chars for full path name -- not tested. } 
    
    Funky Bomb has some sync problems in multiplayer. Roller sometimes follows different paths.
     {multiplayer dirt sync needs checking. }
		
    Game freezes when "NO TANK GRAVITY".
     {fixed -- tank falling routine. }
		 
    Game freezes when tank has float.
     {fixed -- tank falling routine. }
		 
    Added water options to Editor menu of placeWater, setWaterColor & removeWater.
     {Code was not connected to menu. Added flowWater. }
		 
    Computer AI shows the wrong missile on the screen at various times.
     {fixed -- leaves the missile display at zero.}

     
    
Level Bugs
==========
    Tank sliding in Egyptian Pyramid level.
     {? -- need to modify artwork or reposition tank.}
    
    Stalactite placement in Carlsbad. 
     {? -- Okay, where do they go?}
    
    Tank Fall in Antarctica.
     {? -- tank slide. need to modify artwork or reposition tank.}
    
    Fix refinery level so you can't fall down the right-hand side.
     {? -- I think this was fixed by someone??}
    
    Siberian Cave needs water.
     {? -- how high? }
     
    fix object placement boxes
     {fixed -- assume this was refering to the sprite placement.}
    
    Lose health at bottom of "Mouth of Inferno".
     {fixed -- added red liquid to show larva heat damage.}
    
    
Additions
=========
    new Computer AI sprites.
    Each AI computer gets their own respective tank.
     {? -- smackbringer has artwork. To be added to data file. }
    
    Text listing of a level in the Editor.
     {Added -- needs interface clean up. }
    
    Capability to use scripting to modify a level.
     {? -- mod deleted. Has memory leak. }
    
    Ability to add non-falling dirt to a level.
     {Added -- Need to document methods. Uses pixel(0,0) on foreground.
      If not set then finds an unused colour from foreground.}
    
    Tunnel laser. Can bore hole and drive into it.
     {Added -- Modified to leave concrete on top edge only.}
    
    Earthquake mole. Good for breaking up smooth surfaces to stop lava flow.
     {? -- Deleted. Was just a weapon code try out. }
    
    
    
Annoying items (maybe looked at much later)
==============
    When you launch a Sentry Pod, lava has a chance of going off before the Sentry Pod does.
    It will land, then lava comes up, THEN the Sentry Pod goes off.
     {? --  }
    
    Bots can have super weapons when humans have to work for them.
    They should only be allowed to use them when you unlock them.
     {? --  }
        
    make the AI's smarter, they do stupid things.
    Like fire beam weapons up when target is down.
     {? --  }
      
    Bots do not recognize weapon-specific damage patterns; when using turrets, pods,
     and (secret character's weapon) the bots fire at the center of the tank instead 
     of off to the side, and when using direct-fire weapons sometimes bots try to 
     shoot through obviously too big hills.
     {? --  }
    
    If you are at the bottom of a level, or underwater, a missile will do 147 damage instead of 105. 
     {? --  }
    
    Need to have a way to make the tank barrel visible behind/outside of the NIV shield.
     {part fixed -- gap in NIV shield allows barrel to be seen. }
      
    Need to have a way to make the tank barrel visible against the background.
     {part fixed -- Removed blend from barrel so it should be sharper/more contrast.} 
    
    
    
Balance Weapons
===============
    The flak is way too powereful.
    [The flak Detonator will still kill someone with a direct hit, however, the shards are more spaced out
     and make it harder to hit, and the shards themselves are weaker.]
     {enough for now}
    
    The funky bomb is as over-powered, if not MORE over-powered, than the Flak Detonator. 
     $6,500 for 3... That's just over $2,000 each. The problem is, each fragment does 50-200 damage each,
     and then the center explodes with the force of a mini-nuke. That's close to 1000 points of damage for           $2000. I've seen 3 full-powered un-shielded tanks killed by a single Funky Bomb. 
     {later}
    
    The sniper that uses the twin elec lances always hits the same guy dead on twice.
     The sniper should spred the second shot out.
     {The lances kill what is between them. Need to put an offset into the shot. Only used by sniper.}
    
    
    
Art Issues
========== 
    Redo Orbital Satellite Beam 
    
    
    
The "I Want" list
=================
    Slow down funky bomb animation?
     {more details required }
    
    Add Tank Death sayings from Scorched Earth?
     {later -- is there a copyright problem?? }
    
    Add menu item to editor to make water particles flow.
     {later }
    
From dcsteve
    1. More weapons- mud weapons, funky nukes. 
    2. More secrets- to have special items to be unlockable based on finding them in the level.
       Example, in the pyramid level, if you dig up the entire area where the tomb is, you get
       some kind of pyramid mud weapon or something for the duration of the game.
       {Level scripting may be of use here!! }

Bugs fixed by TwelveBaud in release 0.99cR2

    The reason multiplayer doesn't work is because ShadowFang forgot to draw the
     background of the player select screen in the multiplyaer player setup routine! 
    
    Updated versions of Allegro and the C Runtime.
		
    Fixed only having Ricky and Marie be able to have the Funky Bomb.
    {Now avaible to all players.} Funky Bomb has some sync problems in multiplayer.
		
    Limits players to purchasing a maximum of one superweapon. It does not apply to computer players.
		 
    Fixed the spelling error of "Floatation Device". 
		 
    Fixed character unlocks.
     {ShadowFang plumb forgot to call the code that checks if you should get a secret character.}
