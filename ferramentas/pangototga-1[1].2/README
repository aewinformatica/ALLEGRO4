PangoToTGA is used to create a glpyh sheet from a font.

Usage:

In the program, first select a font. There's a font selector letting you select
any font Pango has access to. Next, select a character range. These are unicode
ranges.

Then, select a color range. The color range is used for anti-aliasing. There's
currently no way to output non-antialiased fonts. Then export to a TGA. That's
all, now load the TGA in Gimp, and start working on your bitmap font.

The TGA will have a palette in the format the Allegro library expects it for its
bitmap fons. The color range specifies the palette colors used for the font.
